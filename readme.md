# ABSTRACT
The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is a widely used personality assessment tool that aims to identify an individual's psychological preferences in how they perceive the world and make decisions. The MBTI has been applied in various fields, including career development, team building, and personal growth. The MBTI test consists of a series of questions designed to measure an individual's preferences on four dichotomies: Extraversion (E) vs. Introversion (I), Sensing (S) vs. Intuition  (N), Thinking (T) vs. Feeling (F), and Judging (J) vs. Perceiving (P). In this Myers-Briggs Personality Prediction project, we aim to build a machine learning model that can predict an individual's MBTI personality type based on their written communication, such as social media posts or emails. This project has significant implications for various applications, including improving customer experience, optimizing team dynamics, and developing personalized coaching programs. Through this project, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of how language use and personality type are related and to develop a robust tool for personality prediction. 

# INTRODUCTION
The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is a psychological assessment tool that helps individuals identify their psychological preferences in how they perceive the world and make decisions. The MBTI is based on the theory of psychological types proposed by Carl Jung and was developed by Katharine Cook Briggs and her daughter Isabel Briggs Myers. The MBTI is widely used in various fields, including career development, team building, and personal growth. The assessment consists of a series of questions designed to measure an individual's preferences on four dichotomies: extraversion (E) vs. introversion (I), sensing (S) vs. intuition (N),  (T) vs. feeling (F), and judging (J) vs. perceiving (P).
• Extraversion (E) vs. Introversion (I) measures an individual's preference for either the external world of people, events, and things (Extraversion) or the internal world of ideas, emotions, and reflections (Introversion).
• Sensing (S) vs. Intuition (N) measures an individual's preference for either concrete information obtained through the five senses (Sensing) or abstract information and patterns (Intuition).
• Thinking (T) vs. Feeling (F) measures an individual's preference for making decisions based on logical analysis and objective criteria (Thinking) or personal values and feelings (Feeling).
• Judging (J) vs. Perceiving (P) measures an individual's preference for either a structured and organized lifestyle (Judging) or a flexible and spontaneous lifestyle (Perceiving).

Each dichotomy in the MBTI assessment yields a score between two opposing poles, and individuals are classified as one of 16 personality types based on their combined scores. The 16 personality types are based on four-letter codes, such as ESTJ, INFP, or ENTP. The MBTI assessment has been subject to criticism for its validity and reliability, as well as its oversimplification of personality. Some researchers have argued that the MBTI lacks empirical support and that its dichotomies do not adequately capture the complexity of personality. Despite its criticisms, the MBTI remains a widely used assessment tool, and its popularity can be attributed to its accessibility and ease of use. The MBTI has been used in various fields, including career counseling, organizational development, and personal growth. It is often used in team-building exercises to help individuals understand their own and others' communication styles and preferences.
